# APT-decoding-for-NOAA-satellites
Python SDR is a Software Defined Radio developed in Python with GNU Radio to decode and process weather images from NOAA satellites. It can decode directly from an SDR device, a RAW file or a .wav file, and can perform Doppler correction as well as image syncronization. Finnaly it can return false color images created directly from the infrarred images obtained from decoding.

It's recommended to install GNU-Radio in order to run the software (Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with GNU-Radio 3.7)
